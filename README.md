###Simple and Smart Air Purifier System
######An easy setup for smart air purifier system. This system use Amazon IoT with MQTT protocol to get real-time data of air quality condition.

The presence of dust in homes, offices, and other human environments are unavoidable. In fact, according to the Environmental Protection Agency, indoor air can be 2 to 5 times more polluted than outdoor air. This airborne pollution contributes to minor annoyances such as itchy eyes, sneezing, and headaches to human beings. Worst still, it can be a major contributing factor to severe allergies, life-threatening asthma.

To solve this problem, a working air purifier machine well address this issue. But, I would like to leverage the advantages of IoT to make the the air purifier smarter. Instead of the conventional way that turning on the air purifier whole day, I would like to implement a “brain - microcontroller” and "sensor” to operate only if the presence of dust reach certain level of awareness, this could save a lot of electricity! And the operational status will be available to my "terminal window" in my laptop or any "MQTT-enabled client" devices whenever I travel to anywhere around the world.
